# Case: Travel Insurance Tool

This is a case build for a job application to showcase my technical skills.

## Requirements

Your customers want to stay insured when travelling. They have two options when they already have a continuous travel insurance.

- Change the coverage of their current continuous travel insurance.
- Take out short-term coverage for the duration of their travel.

Create a tool to aid your customers in selecting the best choice for them, by asking them the following questions:

- The number of people travelling (1 to 4)
- The travel time in days
- Whether the trip takes place in Europe or outside Europe (worldwide coverage)

Included with the case assignment was a decision matrix, based on the answers to the questions above, that is not shown here.
